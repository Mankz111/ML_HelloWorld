## Overview
A simple machine learning model to predict diabetes risk based on clinical features, developed as part of a learning exercise in ML fundamentals. Uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

**Key Features**:
- Binary classification (Diabetic/Non-Diabetic)
- Decision Tree/Random Forest implementation
- Basic web app interface (Streamlit/Flask)

## ⚠️ Important Notes
1. **Educational Purpose Only**: This project demonstrates basic ML concepts - **not a real diagnostic tool**.
2. **Simplified Data**: Uses a small dataset with potential biases/limitations.
3. **Accuracy Warning**: Model accuracy (~70-80%) is insufficient for medical use.
